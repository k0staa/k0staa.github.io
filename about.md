# Few words about blog...

 Congratulations! You choose right path and enter my blog ;) I start it long time ago but unfortunatly I haven't got much time and I just forgot about it... but now time has come to clean it up and move to another level.

I will try to talk about the following topics:
  * Java Programming language and all kind of it's flavours,
  * Other programming languages like Ruby, Python, C++, C#, JavaScript and everything else that I will want to try,
  * Using and configuration of my favorite linux distro Arch linux.
I will try to write posts mostly in english but it will probably sometimes happenes that I will write something in polish.

By the way this site is made using Jekyll and it's served from GitHub Pages server. I recently switch to Jekyll from my custom RoR blog because I have not enough time to write blog and develop blog application at the same time.
